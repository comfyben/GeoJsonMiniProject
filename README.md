# GeoJsonMiniProject
Used data.gov to find a GeoJson dataset that shows federally protected forests. Plotted the polygons of protected area on openmaps with feature functions that show relevant information.

The geoJson file was too large to push to git hub so I compressed the file in the data folder. Only 150mb nothing too crazy.
